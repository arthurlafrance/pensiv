//! `pensiv` provides Rust implementations of various AI & machine learning techniques.
//!
//! ## Highlights
//! * Basic probability & statistics functionality
//! * Adversarial search & game trees
//!
//! ## Status
//! `pensiv` is far from complete and thus far from stable. The APIs currently provided are not guaranteed to be stable from version to version
//! because of how new the crate is. Once `v1.0.0` is released (eventually), the APIs provided with that version will be guaranteed to be
//! stable for any `v1.x.y` version as is convention for semantic versioning.
